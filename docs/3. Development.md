
Development Rule
-----

1. no change to MtHaml.there's one except, MtHaml is hacked using composer.json only for whitespace removel (flag < and >).

2. place some variables at MoreEnv::options.
    1. code: MtHaml\More\MoreEnv::__construct
    2. haml file name also be placed in MoreEnv, so it's easy to track the process of calling snip, see MtHaml\More\Environment::parseSnip
    3. how to access MoreEnv object?
        1. use $this->currentMoreEnv in Environment
        2. SnipCaller::getEnv(). MoreEnv obj is attached with SnipCaller to make sure snip parsed using right use files.
            see: test/MtHaml/More/Tests/fixtures/environment/4.3.use snip from other snip file 2.test


Development memorandum
--------

1. Snip called by SnipCaller is invoked by visitor ApplySnip before render stage.  code : MtHaml\More\NodeVisitor\ApplySnip::enterSnipCaller

2. Snip called by InlineSnipCaller is invokded before parse stage.  code:
    1. MtHaml\More\Environment::parseInlineSnipCaller  (InlineSnipCaller is not parsed to an instance of Node for simplify)

3. SnipCaller/InlineSnipCaller can call snip located same file, because current file is added to snipfiles array. code:
    1. MtHaml\More\Snip\SnipHouse::getSnipAndFiles

4. Output of InlineSnipCaller and InlinePlaceholder are trimed, code :
    1. MtHaml\More\Snip\SnipHouse::parseInlineSnipCaller   rtrim(x,"\n")
    2. MtHaml\More\Snip\SnipHouse::renderSnipTree   rtrim(x,"\n") and ltrim(x), does this ltrim kill any spaces that not is indent space?

5. the only use of Log is to record the process of calling snip. code:
    1. MtHaml\More\Environment::__construct  $options['log'] ; $options['debug'](enable log)
    2. MtHaml\More\NodeVisitor\PhpRenderer::enterSnipCaller

6. how indent works well? code:
    1. MtHaml\More\Environment::__construct  $options['baseIndent']
    2. MtHaml\More\NodeVisitor\ApplySnip::__construct

7. "@snipName %h1 hello", "_ %h1 hello", "@@@ %h1 hello", there are legal.see code: MtHaml\More\Parser::parseSnipCaller, parsePlaceholder, parsePlaceholderValue, they all use " $this->parseStatement($buf)) "

8. How whitespace removel (< >) work ?
	1. hack node relation (getParent/getNextSibling/getPreviousSibling/getFirstChild/getLastChild) . maybe it's not jet mature. see : hackNodeAbstract.php, hackNestAbstract.php
	2. how to hack MtHaml file? use composer.json classmap

9. SnipCaller and Snip content, PlaceHolder and Placehoder value, they are abstracted by FirstInterface and SecondInterface for whitespace removel hack.

10. PlaceholderDefaultCaller does not implement FirstInterface for simpleness, '$node->addChilds' is used.
